Our projects relies on the principlees of Augmented reality , our project has complex anatomical model to patient specific conditions and provides preoperative procedures .
Considering the size restriction o n uploads in GitHub we are not able to upload the models we have made . 
So , I would be adding a link to the Google Drive Folder which has the required codes for the project and the prototype images along with it .
